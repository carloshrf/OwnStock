# Welcome to OwnStock!

This is my first own project for learning purposes. The OwnStock is a API REST developed for small inventory applications. it is currently in development and constantly updated, so I will be improving the information about the API.

>To start it, just execute the command "yarn" in the ./backend folder and after the dependencies synchronization, "yarn dev" to start the service, developed for postgres database.
